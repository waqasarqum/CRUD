### DfE Cloud Specialism - Final Project
# CAR HIRE COMPANY
## Waqas Arqum

## Objective


The objective for this DevOps project is to design and create a web application through Flask that integrates with two databases sharing a one-to-many relationship and demonstrates CRUD functionality.

My Web Application will be created using the following: Python, Flask, Ubuntu Linux, Docker, Jenkins and Microsoft Azure.

## My Project

My app will be an easily manageable database that can be used by car hire companies to keep records of any vehicle booking details, as well as the details of customers.

## Planning, Design and Project Tracking

### Trello

Trello is kanban-style, list-making application. I used this to keep track of my project and ensure all tasks were planned for and completed in a timly manner.
